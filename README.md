## WIFI_APP
### App Description
An App which allows users to view and purchase access to nearby WiFi networks based on current location.
### App Idea Evaluation
- Mobile: This realtime and location based app will simplify the user experience when searching for WiFi networks. Users won't need to reload current location to update nearby WiFi networks, the app will do the hard work for them.
- Story: The solution to the decade old problem of needing high speed and convenient access to the internet while on the go is about to be solved through our WiFi app. Whether users are researching nearby restaurants or entertainment, struggling to complete their work before their deadline, or any other pressing matter while on the go, the WiFi app will use realtime technology to link them to nearby networks in exchange for a small fee.
- Market: Because internet access has become a necessity in recent years, the market is quite large. The general public will be the target audience as well as those who are being paid for the wifi service they are giving to the users.
- Habit: This app, if successful in practice, will definitely be a favorite of the user as they will be compelled to open and use the app every time they are away from home and in need of internet without the fear of overusing data  and worrying about speed and strength of their cellular network.
- Scope: A main feature that will take time to perfect is the realtime component that will allow the user to see updated results of WiFi networks in a matter of milliseconds.
